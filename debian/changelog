pytest-httpbin (0.3.0-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/patches:
    - Add patch 0002 to replace the upstream's issued SSL certificates.
      Debian's standards regarding SSL certificates increased. Now, a less
      than 2048 bit long certificate isn't safe enough. We replace the
      upstream's issued certs with these. (Closes: 907168)
  * d/control:
    - Bump Standards-Version to 4.2.1. No change required

pytest-httpbin (0.3.0-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/patches:
    - Add patch 0001 to fix non-working tests since pytest 3.6 release.
      Since 3.6 release of pytest, calling fixture multiple times is not
      allowed. As conftest needs, to work properly, to know that
      httpbin_ca_bundle is a fixture, we use a derivative (essentially a
      dummy function) that we decorate. Hence the tests pass properly and the
      pytest requirements are still fulfilled. The alternative (setting the
      autouse on the httpbin_ca_bundle in plugin.py) is not possible without
      breaking pytest-httpbin's current API.
  * d/control:
    - Bump Standards-Version to 4.1.5. No change required
    - Add Rules-Requires-Root: no
